###  â—¾ About this project
Project was developed to maximize energy transfer from 3,5kW solar array into heaters installed in 1000l heat buffer.
You can find similar systems already in market, ready to purchase but no one had power that I needed.
Below you can find schematic of the idea how to store small, medium and big amounts of heat generated by DC current from solar array.

###  This version is in testing stage
